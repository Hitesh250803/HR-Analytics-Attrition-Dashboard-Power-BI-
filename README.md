🧩 Problem Statement

High employee turnover increases costs and disrupts operations. HR teams need a clear view of who is leaving, why, and where to focus retention efforts. This project delivers a Power BI dashboard that uncovers attrition trends and risk factors, enabling proactive, data-driven retention strategies.

🎯 Project Objectives

• Analyze attrition by department, age group, tenure, and demographics

• Identify key drivers of resignation (e.g., compensation, overtime)

• Highlight high-risk employee segments for targeted retention efforts

• Track attrition trends over time to support long-term planning

• Provide interactive dashboards for HR managers and leadership

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

• Overall Attrition Rate → e.g., 16% of employees

• High-Risk Department → e.g., Sales with 28% attrition

• Attrition by Age Group → e.g., 26–30 years highest risk

• Income & Overtime Correlation → Lower income + overtime = higher exits

• Tenure Impact → Employees with <2 years most likely to leave

👉 KPIs are displayed in card visuals with trend arrows (▲/▼) for quick interpretation.
